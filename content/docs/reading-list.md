These reading orders were randomly selected from my compiled to-read list.

## My non-genre to read list (nominally in-order)

1. *In Search of Lost Time* by Marcel Proust

    Proust's multi-volume work originally published in French between 1913 and 1927 as *À la recherche du temps perdu*.
    Originally published in English as *Remembrance of Things Past*.
    All seven volumes are well-regarded, but the most read is Volume 1: *Swann's Way* (particularly the third part, "Swann in Love").

    There is a version available by Standard Ebooks, but the only public domain translation is C. K. Scott Moncrieff's.
    I'm not opposed to that translation, but after reading about the available translations, I'd want to at least read one of the later revised versions or a different translation altogether.

    Particularly:
    - *Swann's Way*, translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff, edited and annotated by William C. Carter (Yale, 2013), or
    - *The Swann Way*, translated by Brian Nelson, edited by Adam Watt (Oxford, 2023)
        - Only the first volume is available so far, so I would need to switch editions if I continue with the next volumes (or wait for the next volumes by Oxford Press)

    **Personal notes**:
    I won't be reading all seven volumes to start off.
    I plan to read just the first volume and depending on how I enjoy it, return to the rest after I've gotten through more of my TBR list.
